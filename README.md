# Smart Washing Machine Controller Simulator

---
### Overview

This project simulates a **smart washing machine controller** using the PIC16F877A microcontroller. Developed during a virtual internship with **Emertexe Information and Technology Solutions**, this project demonstrates product development lifecycle and embedded C proficiency.

### Features

- Loading screen with initialization feedback.
- Multiple wash program selections via digital keypad.
- Water level management and control.
- Real-time timer display for cycles.
- Peripheral integration: 16x2 CLCD, buzzer, fan, keypad, all via GPIO in 4-bit mode.
- State-machine-based controller logic.
- Simulation tested using PICsimLab.
