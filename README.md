A project built under the guidance of **Emertexe Information and Technology Solutions** to design, simulate, and test an embedded smart washing machine controller.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This simulation-based project uses the PIC16F877A microcontroller to emulate a smart washing machine controller. Key peripherals include a 16x2 CLCD, digital keypad, buzzer, fan, and Timer2, all integrated through Embedded C.

---

## 🎯 Problems Solved

- Inflexible legacy washing machine interfaces
- Lack of real-time operation monitoring
- Limited wash program customization
- Need for accurate state-machine based automation

---

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Loading animations & feedback**
- **Multiple wash program selections**
- **Real-time water level sensing**
- **Configurable timer and program status display**
- **State-machine architecture for safety & efficiency**
- **Peripheral interfacing in 4-bit GPIO mode**
